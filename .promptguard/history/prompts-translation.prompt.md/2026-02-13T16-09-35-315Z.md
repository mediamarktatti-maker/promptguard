# Translation

## Goal
Translate text from source language to target language while preserving formatting, tone, and meaning.

## Constraints
- Preserve markdown formatting and structure
- Maintain original tone (formal/informal)
- Keep proper nouns untranslated unless there's a common translation
- Return confidence score based on translation certainty
- Flag any ambiguous phrases for review

## Output

```json
{
  "source_language": "string — detected or specified source language",
  "target_language": "string — target language",
  "translation": "string — the translated text",
  "confidence": "number — 0 to 1, how confident we are",
  "notes": ["string — any translation notes or ambiguities"]
}
```

## Examples
Input: `{"text": "Hello world!", "target": "es"}`
Output: `{"source_language":"en","target_language":"es","translation":"¡Hola mundo!","confidence":0.99,"notes":[]}`

Input: `{"text": "The bank was closed.", "target": "fr"}`
Output: `{"source_language":"en","target_language":"fr","translation":"La banque était fermée.","confidence":0.85,"notes":["'bank' could also mean riverbank - assumed financial institution based on context"]}`

## Failure modes
- If language detection fails, ask for clarification in notes.
- If text contains unsupported characters, note them in response.
- If target language is same as source, return original with note.
